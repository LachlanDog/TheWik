## Saving Holmgren

Lachlan tries to offer to surrender his personal quest for vengeance to kill the person who killed his master.

-”A life for a life is a trade. But, I have already given you a life, but you have already taken.”

“I will accept your proposal, with an addition. You must do as you say, but you must also dedicate yourself to instilling this same value as him *points to Holmgren* within your lifetime.”

LACHLAN GOTTA BECOME HOLMGREN’S SPIRIT GUIDE -- stop his quest for revenge against the spirit guardian.

  

Lachlan agrees and Holmgren immediately wakes back up.
