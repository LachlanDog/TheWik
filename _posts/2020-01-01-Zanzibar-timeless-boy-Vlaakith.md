“**Grenwold**. You’ve said, time and time again, **you knew who had this exalted staff, and where they’ve gone**. Her patience grows very thin. You wander through these **planes** like a wildling. Your gift was not given without strings, and they grow taut in her grasp. She... is timeless. You...are timeless. For now. **The shadow will follow the boy**. Bring him to **the divide**, or we will. And not without leaving your fate to the **voidstones**, which will be your only companions. Dictated but not read, Vlaakith CLVII”
