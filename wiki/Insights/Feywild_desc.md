 Feywild, thought to exist as blanket over material plane… not exactly mirror but… potent similarities… mountain ranges…

So our cavern here is still the layline… time is tricky, creatures are tricky… love deals and bargains...An echo of the material plane.

Magic can be ...moves freely and much more powerful here… when people leave they may lose their memory, lots of magical creatures. 

Multiple courts… winter summer spring autumn courts… summer and winter main opposing factions, spring autumn… pounce when time is right… very opportunistic courts… not to obliterate but vying for power.

  

**Summer winter most ruthless** and most hatred of each other. Other neutral courts apparently, twilight. [[../../people/Factions/Feywild_Courts]]

Feywild… divide between ceily court - summer, unceily court - Winter?

Ceily- good, unceily- evil fey

Unseely, seelie court. #feywild #feywildCourts

Fey known for making deals, chaos, some level of order, kings and queens. Archfey (kings queens) inner circles…

  

Fey, inferior fey don’t exist to them, insignificant.  Each own little patheon, shifts over history who rules. All thought to be from one original pantheon.
