Wolf of bones blue glow, scratching howling… wolves with golden melting eyes, like a shadow silent…
#MagicWolves
  

“But you can’t say they weep nonono, that word doesn’t belong here, it belongs… HERE….”

  

Third wolf monstrosity, body covered with oozing weeping eyes… “No air, no drink, no sleep it feeds on souls” Creature lets out dirge… Wolf lets our dirge ou’re forced to stare at it….

  

3rd wolf… no trees around it… in different area than the others… Clawing around in emptiness… mournful song…

Gave us visions? We hear the call but at a distance… call of the 3rd….place of emptiness… sense of hostility… breath sucked out of us…
